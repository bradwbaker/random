"Being an immigrant from Eastern Europe, I know it’s hard the get a good job without college degree, English as a secondary language and huge cultural difference you have to learn through your experience. So I’m trying to compensate this with the hard work and constant self-education. But I understand that my situation is not even close to the people who experienced loosing their freedom and now being judged based on the past or current situation.
I can only complain that I can’t afford something like bootcamp because I have to support my family here and abroad.
At the same time I’m tired of learning on my own and feel like I stuck with the “tutorial trap” - definitely need some help and guidance from people from industry to complete the final steps to be ready to apply for a job. Since I already have some knowledge I think I can help other people who just started their iOS journey with understanding basic concepts. It would be great to meet new people from the community and of course learn as a part of the group.

"I'm just looking for an opportunity to receive instruction from people successful in this area of expertise that can guide me toward becoming successful myself.

Ultimately, I would like to pay it forward, and do the same for others.

The way I see it is that not everyone is born at the same point in the race of life. Some are born at the finish line, others in the middle of the race, and most at the starting line...

Then there are those who are born in deep pit, shackled and chained, that must dig themselves out, and break free before they can even begin to run the race. I want to help these people. I want them to know that these are not fundamental truths about who they are; nor do they dictate where they can go in life.

I want them to have the same opportunity as everyone else, and help them actualize their potential; I just have to finish getting there myself.

I'm going to get there one way or another, or at the very least, die trying.
